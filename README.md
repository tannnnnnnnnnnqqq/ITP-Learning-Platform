# Java Learning Platform - [Course Name: Introduction to Programming]

## Project Description

This project is a learning application developed in Java to help students in the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology (FCSIT) learn a core course. The learning app focuses on a subtopic from a first- or second-year course, such as **Introduction to Programming** or **Discrete Mathematics**.

### Learning Module

The app includes a learning module with at least 10 pages/screens that provide educational content on the chosen subtopic. The content includes text and images, and optionally audio or video to enhance learning.

### Quiz Module

The app features a quiz module with at least **20 questions** of varying types such as:
- Multiple-choice
- Fill-in-the-blanks
- True/false
- Matching
- Short answer

### Gamification

To motivate students, the app incorporates gamification elements, such as:
- Points
- Timers
- Leaderboards

These elements encourage students to engage more actively and compete with peers.

### Database

The app stores student scores in a text file, array, or Java DB, but a database is not required as part of the course. The storage method should not be hard-coded, and the data should not be manually entered.

### Requirements

- **No User Login**: The app does not require user authentication.
- **No Additional Libraries or Packages**: The app should be able to run without needing external libraries or installation steps, except for the Java runtime environment.
- **UML Design**: The project design follows the Unified Modelling Language (UML) for clarity in implementation.
